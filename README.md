# Periodic SSH Chain – Master Thesis Code

This repository contains numerical and analytical calculations 
for the periodic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model developed 
as part of my Master's thesis research at EPFL.

The project focuses on:

- Construction of the SSH Hamiltonian
- Implementation of periodic boundary conditions
- Eigenvalue spectrum computation
- Analytical comparison of numerical results
- Visualization of energy bands
- Concurrence Plots
- Entanglement Phase Transition
